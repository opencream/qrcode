# ðŸ“¦ Smart Storage Box Manager (QR Code Linked)

- Add/edit:
  - Description
  - Date and time
  - List of contents
- Mobile-friendly dark-themed UI
- Automatically readable from QR codes
- Local file-based storage (no database required)
- Easy to deploy on Replit, Render, VPS, or Orange Pi

1. Print a QR code linking to `/box/box001`, tape it to your physical box.
2. Scan the QR code with your phone.
